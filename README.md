# This is where identifiers die

This project collects identifiers that are, for some reason, no longer pointing to active records
in the corresponding database. As such, these identifiers should no longer be used. By collecting
them in a machine readable way, we can make it easier to automate the detection of dead identifiers
in data curation workflows.
